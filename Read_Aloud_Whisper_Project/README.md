# MSFT Words' 'Read Aloud' function in Python.

## What is it?
Microsoft Word has a handy feature called 'Read Aloud' where the computer will read back to you the text you have entered.
It's a great tool to help check if what you have written makes sense or not (outside of your own head). 

OpenAI recently released 'Whisper', their general-purpose speech recognition model and i wanted to include it into a project. This is my first Python Audio project.

This program records your audio and speaks it back to you with the added option of writing the results to a txt file, for you to copy/paste into your email.

## Why?
Check if what you say makes sense before you send it!
